### Current Status of the Firefox and Chrome Plugin for TypingClub Stories

At this moment, the plugin for Firefox and Chrome designed for stories from [https://www.edclub.com/sportal/](https://www.edclub.com/sportal/) is not functioning as intended. While the plugin allows users to download lesson text, uploading translations does not work properly. The website's script overwrites the uploaded text, causing the translation to disappear for every word after a space, as it waits for the original text.
### Temporary Solution

A temporary workaround is to start the lesson, type a single letter, and then proceed with the lesson by uploading the text into [https://monkeytype.com/](https://monkeytype.com/) and selecting **Custom â†’ Change**.

## Note on Translations

The translations provided in this repository were generated by ChatGPT and have been reviewed and checked in practice by a native Polish teacher. 

For comparison and verification, a second translation has been provided using [https://bielik.ai/](https://bielik.ai/).
